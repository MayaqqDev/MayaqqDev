I Mod, I game, I silly
<br>Modder and an Occasional Shitposter
<br>*removed all the professional jargon from this README in 2024*

I am a mainly Minecraft modder who makes open-source, community focused Minecraft Mods and other projects which I love! I have about 5 years of experience in java and Minecraft modding, though I am proficient in a few more (see below).
I also manage an awesome community! You can join by clicking the button at the bottom of this page.
